This is my personal website! The current version hosted [here](https://iamchrishsu.com) is the reduced branch, which has minimal features while the master branch is under development. 

## Running Instructions

To build the project and run it on your own machine:

### `npm ci`

Completes a clean install of the React project. This script will install everything you need to start the project.

### `npm start`

After the command executes, the app should be hosted at localhost:3000 \
The project can now be accessed on localhost:3000 like any other URL,


## Is this hosted / on the internet?
Yes! This project is currently deployed on AWS. AWS Route 53 is used for domain name and hosted zones. AWS Amplify is used to deploy the website itself.
